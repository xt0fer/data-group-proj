# Ideas for ZCW/Data Group Projects

## Data Science Group Project Ideas.

- 1-3 wks in duration
- 3-5 people in the group

Each project needs to produce:

- Serious Data gathering or API access for data supply.
- Some UX or DataViz output, plus a dashboard for project orientation
- A cache, SQL, or NoSQL db as backing data source (or even more sophisticated like a data lake, or warehouse.)
- Some code in Python, Scala, or ...
- a well-documented process for ETL, data pipelines, & analytical products

### Recommender System

### Google clone with Indexing, Map/Reduce.

### Machine Learning 

image classification, character recog, etc.

### Natural Language Processing 

sentiment analysis, n-gram models, grammars, topic or entity modeling.

### Neural Networks

defeating CAPTCHA, (maybe this is just ML again?)

### Unsupervised Learning Project

clustering, hierarchical clustering, 

### a GIS-specific data project

something with maps, data and analysis.



## Also from this day:

### Overall Cross-Tech ideas 

Ideas that need to be reinforced across Python, R and other tools;
- statistics
- probability
- hypothesis & inference
- gradient descent
- k-nearest neighbors
- naive bayes
- linear, multi-, logistical regressions
- clustering
- and all kinds of Data Exploration

### Pet Data Set

Additionally, I think each student should have Pet Data Set.
A favorite data set that they can:
- describe in detail
- get passionate about
- know interesting things about its
  - use
  - pecularities
  - provenance of the set
  - history
  - knowledge of famous uses of set
  - applicability to some problem.

> Examples might be the 1854 London Cholera Outbreak
> Titanic Passengers, World Population Prospects,
> GDP/Capita->ChildMortality, Significant Earthquakes,
> Enron Emails, Anscombe's Quartet, Characters in Les Miserables,
> NY TLC Trip data, Napoleon's March, and the TPC Benchmarks for Database simulations.
